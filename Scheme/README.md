For the third programming assignment, we had to create a parser that counts the number and depth of the statements that are input in the Scheme programming assignment. I used Racket for my implementation, but we were limited in commands we were allowed to use and ensure it ran on the RLogin cluster. See the project spec (PDF) for more information about the project.
