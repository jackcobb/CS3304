For the second project in CS 3304, we had to create a recursive descent lexical analyzer in C. See the input file for possible input and formats, and check the output to see how it outputs. 

Missing the original project spec.

Invocation:
./program2 < infile > outfile

Makefile:
make/make all - Compiles the source code into an executable with the static flag
make clean - Removes the executable in the directory for a clean make

What works:
All of the test inputs give the correct output. It appears that all functionality is present in the program.
